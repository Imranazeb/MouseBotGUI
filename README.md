# __Mouse Click Bot__

This program will emulate at random time intervals mouse clicks on a specified location on the screen. 

Download the zip file and unpack the contents into a folder, then click on main.exe file to run. Place the mouse cursor where you would like clicks to be emulated. The program will allow a few seconds to place the cursor as the program initializes, so it may be better to decide the position of the cursor beforehand. Once initialization is completed the program will click the selected spot at random intervals. 

**IMPORTANT:** At first download your anti-virus will categorize this program as a risk because it is a script. ***It will need to be marked safe and added to antivirus exceptions. When run, windows will block it and you need to choose more options>run anyway.*** (This needs to be done only once.) Rest assured this is not a virus and source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Imranazeb/MouseClickBot/blob/master/main.py)
