# __Mouse Click Bot__

This program will emulate at random time intervals mouse clicks on a specified location on the screen. 

Download the main.exe to use. 

**IMPORTANT:** The browser will recognize it as an uncommon file and you will have to choose 'keep anyway' option. Also, your anti-virus will categorize this program as a risk because it is an executable. ***It will need to be marked safe and added to antivirus exceptions. When run, windows may block it and you need to choose more options>run anyway.*** (This needs to be done only once.) Rest assured this is not a virus and source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Imranazeb/MouseBotGUI/blob/master/main.py) 

Place the mouse cursor where you would like clicks to be emulated. The program will allow a few seconds to place the cursor as the program initializes, so it may be better to decide the position of the cursor beforehand. Once initialization is completed the program will click the selected spot at random intervals.
