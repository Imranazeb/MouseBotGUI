### This program will emulate mouse clicks at random on a specified location on the screen. 
___
### INSTALLATION:
Download the main.zip (scroll to bottom) file to a folder and extract main.exe. **IMPORTANT:**  Because this is an executable, your anti-virus may categorize this program as a risk and/or it may quarantine it. ***It will need to be marked safe and added to antivirus exceptions, or it may need to be removed from quarantine. When run, windows may block it and you need to choose more options>run anyway.*** (This needs to be done only once. If you get stuck there are many Youtube videos on how to do all of this.) Rest assured this is not a virus and source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Imranazeb/MouseBotGUI/blob/master/main.py). 
___
### USAGE:
Place the mouse cursor where you would like clicks to be emulated. The program will allow a few seconds to place the cursor as the program initializes, so it may be better to decide the position of the cursor beforehand. Once initialization is completed the program will click the selected spot at random intervals.
