### This program will emulate mouse clicks at random on a specified location on the screen. 
___
### INSTALLATION:
Download the relevant (scroll to bottom) to a folder and double click to run. **IMPORTANT:**  Because this is an executable, 

- on windows: your anti-virus may categorize this program as a risk and/or it may quarantine it. ***It will need to be marked safe and added to antivirus exceptions, or it may need to be removed from quarantine. When run, windows may block it and you need to choose more options>run anyway.*** (This needs to be done only once. If you get stuck there are many Youtube videos on how to do all of this.) 
- On MAC you will have to allow opening files form unknown developers. This can be done by going into ***system-perferences>security-and-privacy>general and choosing open anyway. When run, you will have to allow the program to take control of your computer in privacy settings. It might be best to then close the program and restart it***.

Rest assured this is not a virus, and by taking control of youc computer it is limiting itself to mouse functinos.  The source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Imranazeb/MouseBotGUI/blob/master/main.py). If you want to compile it yourself please look up extensive Python documentation on the web.

### USAGE:
Place the mouse cursor where you would like clicks to be emulated. The program will allow a few seconds to place the cursor as the program initializes, so it may be better to decide the position of the cursor beforehand. Once initialization is completed the program will click the selected spot at random intervals.
